          <h1>Why Dermatoglyphics Neuro Scientific Analysis?</h1>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            You must understand why we do the Dermatoglyphics Neuro Scientific
            Analysis or fingerprint analysis. If you understand your mother and
            father, let us suppose your mother is an Apple, father is a Mango.
            So both of them are different. They have disparities, they fight,
            they understand, they love, but that's who they are. So there is a
            communication between them which could be cordial, which could be
            disorganized. Because both are talking from their head. And Apple
            will say look at it the Apple way, the Mango will say look at it the
            Mango way.
            <br /><br />
            Now, when the child, a seed, is sown or conceived by both of them,
            that seed is neither an Apple nor a Mango. So this is a hybrid seed.
            So if you look at a family of five children, they are five different
            seeds. They're not the same. The seed has a different. Each seed has
            a different configuration. So though we they say we are all five
            children born to the same parents, why are we so different? We have
            to understand that basically the first step, “Seed is different.” So
            now this hybrid seed which has a unique configuration which is not
            in our control. Now this seed is sown in the mother's womb for nine
            months. This nine months, whatever thoughts experiences, happiness,
            sadness that happens within that mother's brain, the child
            experiences also.<br /><br />
            Because like, if you're happy, your whole body is happy, It's not
            just the brain which is happy. When the child is in the womb
            growing, that is the first environment of the child. And this child
            perceives, understands, listens to everything that the mother is
            going through. This is called “Evolutionary Psychology.” Because
            that's how we all change, Because the environment in the womb is
            different for different people. So every individual is unique, a
            hybrid variety, and there are no two people who are the same.

            <br /><br />Now this nine months is the Game Changer. Whether that
            seed, which has a high potential or a low potential, has to be
            nurtured. If that powerful seed is not nurtured well, the child is
            also weak. In the same way, if the seed is weak, but the environment
            that the mother went through was fantastic, the seed would be
            empowered. We don't know why this happens, but we understand that
            that womb is a very important place for the creation of an
            individual.<br /><br />
            After nine months, when the child is born, once he is born, he is
            defined, he is configured, he has a predisposition which cannot
            change. just like your heart beats automatically, just like your
            stomach digests food automatically, same way the brain thinks
            automatically. This is the automatic way in which our brain. Goes
            through the thought process.

            <br /><br />It is inborn, unconscious, not in our control. This is
            our who we are, our personality, our identity, whatever you might
            call it. We must understand that when a child goes through this,
            whoop experiences the mother's thoughts. It's not that the mother is
            actually influencing the child, but it is the child who creates that
            environment for the mother. So that the child is already destined to
            be in a particular banner. If you see the mother is going through
            those experiences only in those nine months, she doesn't experience
            this afterwards.<br /><br />
            Life keeps changing, but why is this child there at that time? Is
            because this child was meant to be configured that way. Now our
            design is in such a way, this beauty of the creator, that we can,
            through the fingerprints, understand how the brain processes
            information. Now, once the child is born, even though the child is a
            few months or days or years old, this is the way the child's brain
            works automatically.

            <br /><br />There will be 1 cranky kid, there will be 1 happy kid,
            there will be 1 irritable kid. Even in the cradle you will see that
            same behaviour being shown, the attention seeking behaviour, the
            quiet behaviour, the jovial behaviour, the smiling face. You see
            from birth till death. But the problem is that most Psychologists
            feel that children are an empty slate. We have to write on it. They
            don't know anything. Parents also thinking the child doesn't know
            anything. But the child is already coming with the processing
            system, Like the laptop already has a configuration.What we put in
            it is content. <br /><br />
            But the way it processes information is the same. Now once we
            understand the importance of the energy waves, if you look at the
            fingerprint patterns, each of those lines and those ridges talk
            about the energy flow. Now when we look at our fingerprints, these
            fingerprints, these lines can be seen on the fingertips, but these
            lines flow all throughout the body. <br /><br />Dermatoglyphic
            science is all about this lines which is all over our skin. Only
            thing here they emanate and show here this is where the recurves
            happen. The pattern actually shows at least they're just lines which
            go across the body. And here we are learning the energy flow and how
            your fingerprint patterns work for you in this science.
